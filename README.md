# Malaria Diagnosis using CNN & Transfer Learning

This repository contains experiments and notebooks for diagnosing malaria from blood smear images using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transfer learning.

## Models Used

- ResNet50 — Orpheus Manga
- VGG16 — Alice Mukarwema
- InceptionV3 — Daniel Marial Kudum
- MobileNetV2 — Eliel Mtwali
- Advanced CNN — David Cyubahiro

## Notebooks

The workspace includes several Jupyter notebooks demonstrating training, evaluation, and transfer learning with the above models. See the following files:

- `Baseline&Resnet50(Orpheus_Manga).ipynb`
- `Group5_Baseline_Model.ipynb`
- `InceptionV3_CNN_&_Transfer_Learning.ipynb`
